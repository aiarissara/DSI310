In this paper, through an exploratory, Research through Design (RtD) process, we tap into this vast potential space of input interaction that jewelry can enable. We do so by first identifying a small set of fundamental structural elements-called Jewelements-that any jewelry is composed of, and then defining their properties that enable the interaction. We leverage this synthesis along with observational data and literature to formulate a design space of jewelry-enabled input techniques. This work encapsulates both the extensions of common existing input methods (e.g., touch) as well as new ones inspired by jewelry. Furthermore, we discuss our prototypical sensor-based implementations. Through this work, we invite the community to engage in the conversation on how jewelry as a material can help shape wearable-based input.</td>\n",

The study focuses more on Kelantan State due to their popularity and existence of a chain of small and traditional craftsmen. Most local operators are still preserving the traditional way of fabrication and production techniques, tools, methods whilst maintaining the Malay aesthetic value in all aspects of fabrication. This unique value proposition inherited from their legacy lineage was taught throughout the generations and now adopted by the younger craftsmen in rank. Ironically, the manual process and traditional fabrication techniques were seen as less efficient due to the higher amount of gold scrap as compared to modern techniques.Hence, this paper aims to ascertain the findings and to validate the assumptions that the manual and traditional technique does indeed contributes to a higher amount of gold losses that adversely affecting the yield and economic returns of the small fabricators in Kelantan, whilst formulating the right action plans to mitigate and resolve the issues effectively.</td>\n",

Design/methodology/approach The research approach combines a detailed literature review with multiple-case examples. The paper adopts the triple bottom line framework for structuring the analysis and findings, which suggests reporting sustainability efforts in three categories of actions – social, environmental and economic. Findings Prior research suggests that luxury fashion marketing and principles of sustainability may represent contradictory philosophies. However, this paper of case examples suggests that this may no longer be the case. We identify six lessons in guiding future sustainability practices. Practical implications The findings have implications for managers operating in luxury fashion, but the findings are also pertinent to managers in other industries. Originality/value Prior research in luxury fashion has generally focused on the industry’s poor record in sustainability and how luxury and sustainability may be incompatible. In this paper, we conclude that most luxury fashion firms are aware of the need to integrate sustainability into their business models. By uncovering examples of best practice in sustainability, we demonstrate how luxury fashion firms have responded to these challenges with lessons for other industry sectors.</td>\n",

The circular economy is the process that may assist in this transition, the method consists of the circularity of the products, the reuse and proper management of waste generated during each stage of development of a product. The buttons are essential items for clothing, an ancient invention that maintains its function and form to this day. The only change in the production of this accessory was the material employed in production, if in the early days the materials were natural; Currently plastic is the main raw material. Its impact on the environment is ignored, despite the amount existing in relation to each piece of clothing that is discarded incorrectly in urban waste containers. In this article, the problem was addressed around current materials and proposed the development of biodegradable buttons from eating waste. The study was based on the foundations of the circular economy and the design thinking methodology for new product development, rapid prototyping was used as a means of materializing research, resulting in an experimental product.</td>\n",

It comes in many wearable forms, is fashionable, and can adorn any part of the body. In this paper, through an exploratory, Research through Design (RtD) process, we tap into this vast potential space of input interaction that jewelry can enable. We do so by first identifying a small set of fundamental structural elements-called Jewelements-that any jewelry is composed of, and then defining their properties that enable the interaction. We leverage this synthesis along with observational data and literature to formulate a design space of jewelry-enabled input techniques. This work encapsulates both the extensions of common existing input methods (e.g., touch) as well as new ones inspired by jewelry. Furthermore, we discuss our prototypical sensor-based implementations. Through this work, we invite the community to engage in the conversation on how jewelry as a material can help shape wearable-based input.\n",

The study focuses more on Kelantan State due to their popularity and existence of a chain of small and traditional craftsmen. Most local operators are still preserving the traditional way of fabrication and production techniques, tools, methods whilst maintaining the Malay aesthetic value in all aspects of fabrication. This unique value proposition inherited from their legacy lineage was taught throughout the generations and now adopted by the younger craftsmen in rank. Ironically, the manual process and traditional fabrication techniques were seen as less efficient due to the higher amount of gold scrap as compared to modern techniques.Hence, this paper aims to ascertain the findings and to validate the assumptions that the manual and traditional technique does indeed contributes to a higher amount of gold losses that adversely affecting the yield and economic returns of the small fabricators in Kelantan, whilst formulating the right action plans to mitigate and resolve the issues effectively.\n",

Because of this, according to the characteristics of the jewelry industry, this paper selects the free cash flow model to measure the value of the entity. Taking Zhou Dasheng company as an example, this paper introduces it by using Porter’s five forces model. According to the historical free cash flow data, the Grey system prediction model GM(1,1) forecasts the free cash flow in 2021-2024. This article comes up with an assumption where the free cash flow will grow at a constant rate after 2024. Sequentially, using these future free cash flow discounts to the present.Comparing the market value of Zhou Dasheng with the value of the entity which was measured by the free cash flow model. When the market value is lower than the value of the entity, the shareholder should buy more Zhou Dasheng’s shares. On the contrary, the shareholder should sell this company’s shares.\n",

Design/methodology/approach The research approach combines a detailed literature review with multiple-case examples. The paper adopts the triple bottom line framework for structuring the analysis and findings, which suggests reporting sustainability efforts in three categories of actions – social, environmental and economic. Findings Prior research suggests that luxury fashion marketing and principles of sustainability may represent contradictory philosophies. However, this paper of case examples suggests that this may no longer be the case. We identify six lessons in guiding future sustainability practices. Practical implications The findings have implications for managers operating in luxury fashion, but the findings are also pertinent to managers in other industries. Originality/value Prior research in luxury fashion has generally focused on the industry’s poor record in sustainability and how luxury and sustainability may be incompatible. In this paper, we conclude that most luxury fashion firms are aware of the need to integrate sustainability into their business models. By uncovering examples of best practice in sustainability, we demonstrate how luxury fashion firms have responded to these challenges with lessons for other industry sectors. \n",
       "174  Fashion is a waste industry, but it is in a phase of change and transition to sustainability, including consciousness around the excessive use of natural resources to produce inputs for clothing and accessories. In this article, we focus on the problem of waste and sustainable innovations for the fashion industry, adopting ethical and linear solutions to the principles of a circular economy that abandons the current production process of extraction, production and disposal, consuming finite resources already in Imminent risk of raw materials, a fact that came to light during the Covid-19 pandemic. The circular economy is the process that may assist in this transition, the method consists of the circularity of the products, the reuse and proper management of waste generated during each stage of development of a product. The buttons are essential items for clothing, an ancient invention that maintains its function and form to this day. The only change in the production of this accessory was the material employed in production, if in the early days the materials were natural; Currently plastic is the main raw material. Its impact on the environment is ignored, despite the amount existing in relation to each piece of clothing that is discarded incorrectly in urban waste containers. In this article, the problem was addressed around current materials and proposed the development of biodegradable buttons from eating waste. The study was based on the foundations of the circular economy and the design thinking methodology for new product development, rapid prototyping was used as a means of materializing research, resulting in an experimental product.\n",
